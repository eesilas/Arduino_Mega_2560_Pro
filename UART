The Arduino Mega 2560 Pro (based on the ATmega2560 microcontroller) has four UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) interfaces, each with dedicated TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive) pins. Here's the complete list:

UART Pins on Arduino Mega 2560 Pro:
UART0 (Serial)

TX0 → Pin 1 (also labeled TX0)
RX0 → Pin 0 (also labeled RX0)
This is the default serial port used for USB communication with the Arduino IDE.
UART1 (Serial1)

TX1 → Pin 18
RX1 → Pin 19
UART2 (Serial2)

TX2 → Pin 16
RX2 → Pin 17
UART3 (Serial3)

TX3 → Pin 14
RX3 → Pin 15
Notes:
UART0 (Serial) is typically used for programming and debugging via USB.
UART1, UART2, and UART3 can be used for additional serial communication (e.g., GPS, Bluetooth, other microcontrollers).
Avoid using Pin 0 (RX0) and Pin 1 (TX0) for other purposes if you need serial communication.
